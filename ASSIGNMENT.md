Goal
To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

Brief
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

# Delivery

Ensure that the readme.md file describes your project thoroughly, including how to setup and run the project locally and any special instructions for testers.

# What I learned

- Bad idea to toggle different "pages" from homepage since it makes it not possible to restore that state of the page on "back" buttons which makes the page a bit impractical. + hard to get the fresh data to show on initial load without doing a manual reload.

Would rather make a separate actual page instead to make things easier. Mainly an issue due to the "edit" page being the only page that is an actual different page. Either everything should be conditionally rendered or they should all be separate pages.

I had a hard time figuring out how to utilize Redux, and I am still not very confident in using the tool, but I did learn a lot and feel like I got a better understanding of it now.
